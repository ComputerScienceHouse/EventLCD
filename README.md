EventLCD
========

A project using an Arduino Ethernet and LCD character display to show upcoming events in a location from a shared Google calendar.

How to build
--------
I'm using [ino](http://inotool.org) to build the arduino code.

If you use ino, you must delete the Robot_Control library from your Arduino IDE installation ([explanation here](https://github.com/amperka/ino/issues/85)).

If you build using the Arduino IDE, make sure to add the libraries in the lib folder.
